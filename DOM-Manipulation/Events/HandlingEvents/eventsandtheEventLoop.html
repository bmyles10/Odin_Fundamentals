For cases where you really do want to do some time-consuming thing in the background without freezing the page, browsers provide something called web workers. A worker is a JavaScript process that runs alongside the main script, on its own timeline.

Imagine that squaring a number is a heavy, long-running computation that we want to perform in a separate thread. We could write a file called code/squareworker.js that responds to messages by computing a square and sending a message back.

To avoid the problems of having multiple threads touching the same data, workers do not share their global scope or any other data with the main scriptâ€™s environment. Instead, you have to communicate with them by sending messages back and forth.

This code spawns a worker running that script, sends it a few messages, and outputs the responses.

 <script>
     let squareWorker = new Worker("code/squareworkder.js");
     squareWorker.addEventListener("message",event =>{
         console.log("The worker responded:", event.data);
     });

     squareWorker.postMessage(10);
     squareWorker.postMessage(24);

 </script>
