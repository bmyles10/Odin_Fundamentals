        <b>When should you choose Function Declaration versus Function Expression?</b>

        As a rule of thumb, when we need to declare a function, the first to consider is Function Declaration syntax,
        the one we used before. It gives more freedom in how to organize our code, because we can call such functions
        before they are declared.

        It’s also a little bit easier to look up function f(…) {…} in the code than let f = function(…) {…}. Function
        Declarations are more “eye-catching”.

        …But if a Function Declaration does not suit us for some reason (we’ve seen an example above), then Function
        Expression should be used.
